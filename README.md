# Slide-Show

I not a fan of the Slideshow in Windows 10 "Photos" as it has no options, so I built my own.


FEATURES INCLUDE.

Selectable image sizes (Stretch, Fit to screen, Normal size).

Select image rotation speed.

Select image folder.

Quickly Jump through image collection.

Options save to file.


CONTROLS.

ESC to exit.

SPACE to pause.

Left arrow or view previous image.

Right arrow to view next image.

0 - 9 Keys allow the user to jump to slideshow to certain points.
eg. "0" will sjump the slideshow back to the beginning.
"2" will jump the slideshow to 20% the way through the images.
"9" will jump the slideshow to 90% the way through the images.
